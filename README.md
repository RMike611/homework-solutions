# homework-solutions
Homework solutions from my assignments in college that I managed to find.
Due to the nature of how I stored files on different devices, some solutions are the complete version, while others might be older versions of solutions, which is why some of my solutions for problems aren't posted. These files were also submitted after I finished college, making most over 2 years old. Since many of these were written when I first learned to code, I would have written these solutions differently for some of the problems.
Some solutions were made from scratch, while others were based on incomplete code that was given as a framework for how a question wanted the problem was to be solved.
